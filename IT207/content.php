    <h3>Professional</h3>
    <p>I love making things, have a great deal of passion for software development and love learning about new technologies.</p>
    <p>I have worked in software development since finishing high school, including working as a Ruby on Rails developer, lead Android developer for a startup, an app development contractor, and a university programming tutor.</p>
    <p>Currently I am working with a startup to build out their new platform going into the future as well as working on some of my own open-source API tools in JavaScript, Ruby and Crystal.</p>

    </p>
    <h3>Personal</h3>
    <p>I spend a lot of my free time learning new technologies, reading, playing frisbee, futsal or football, and watching television.</p>
    <p>Back in Australia I founded the country's first fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi. Thus far we have grown from 9 members to well over 50 members in the last two years. I spend much of my free time also helping run the organisation.</p>
